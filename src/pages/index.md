        reasons why and how they engage with your products and your services,

  We observe your users to deliver rich insights into their needs, expectations
  and preferences. Often used before new product development to de-risk the
  experience design, ethnographic research can help you develop robust new
  strategies to increase effectiveness and uptake, identify user segments not
  being well served by your current product.
