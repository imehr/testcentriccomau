  Usability testing is the systematic observation of end users attempting to
  complete a task or set of tasks with your product based on representative
  scenarios. In individual sessions, participants interact with your product
  (e.g.,prototype launched product) as they think aloud.

There are times when you want to observe usability testing live to get instant insight. If you are watching from another room, a screen or monitor is necessary to show what you are recording. But that means you need to dedicate a room with costly setup for observation only.



[Luna Display](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/767721702/luna-display), a Kickstarter project seems to be a great solution for that!

It is a hardware solution that turns any iPad into a, wireless second display.



Luna Display extends your Mac desktop to your iPad, creating a wireless second monitor ( which can be a duplicate of your first screen as well) and works with your existing Wi-Fi.



That means you can literally observe the usability testing from anywhere within the Wi-Fi range with no need for a dedicated observation room or expensive setups.



If you already have a TV in your observation room, Apple TV and Chromecast are two other cheap alternatives for mirroring/broadcasting.



Unfortunately none of the above solutions support audio, but there are ways around that which I am going to cover in the next article.



As far as screen extension is concerned (not for usability testing), Luna Display acts as a complete extension to your Mac, allowing you to use it directly from your iPad with full support for external keyboards, Apple Pencil, and touch interactions. It literally turns your Mac into a touchable device, allowing pinching, panning and tapping… making it much more than just a second screen!
