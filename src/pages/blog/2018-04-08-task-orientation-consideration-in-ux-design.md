  Imagine you open an application with clickable memes and advertising banners
  here and there. What makes YOU click on one of them but your colleague in the
  office that has the same interests as yours simply ignores them? There could
  be so many reasons behind that but I only focus on one which is GOAL.

Your colleague has a purpose when she goes on smh.com.au, it’s the first Tuesday of the month and she wants to see if the interest rate has gone up or not. On the other hand, you just go to the same news website to let your mind wander with no particular goal or purpose after a lengthy meeting at work as a sort of a rest button.

The first thing you must do is to learn whether or not you even have a goal. If you do, then any meme that interrupts you will be ignored as a frustrating distraction. If you do not, you will be receptive to unsolicited and unexpected memes, although you will resist any effortful concentration required to engage with you.

Daniel Levitin, a neuroscientist and the author of [The Organized Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315) and [This Is Your Brain ](https://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Brain-Music-Obsession/dp/0452288525/)on Music, summarised one of the biggest neuroscientific discoveries of the recent times which was the existence of two fundamental patterns of activity in the brain: the [Task-Positive Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task-positive_network) ( also known as goal-oriented network) and the [task-negative network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task-negative) (also known as default mode or daydreaming mode). According to Levitin…

The task-positive network is the state you’re in when you have a goal and you’re intensely focused on a task such as writing your resume or doing your taxes, or navigating through a city for the first time.

The task-negative network is the daydreaming or the mind-wandering mode…a special brain network that supports a more fluid and non-linear mode of thinking that thoughts move from one to another.

When one state is active in our brain, the other is not.

In essence, when we are in a task-positive mode, our line of sight is towards where we consciously choose to, in order to reach our goals, and we actively avoid everything else which we treat as an unwanted distraction. Therefore, if a majority of your users are goal-oriented, you should invest on a good search engine tool. You should also avoid (if viable) a business model that supports ads and instead consider a subscription model as the ads would perform poorly since they will be ignored as a frustrating distraction.

On the other hand, when we are in a task-negative mode, we will be receptive to unexpected memes , including advertisements, but still with no intention of solving things. Things like “ similar content suggestions” are perfect for your audience in task-negative mode as they don’t need to make any effort to receive the flow of information that they are interested in. For the same reason, you should avoid asking the daydreaming users to complete lengthy registration forms or anything that would require mental effort.

BUT what if you have audience in both types of brain states?

If you want to satisfy both groups, you need to learn when your users are in each mode and adapt your design accordingly.

Dan Evans, explains in his book, [Bottlenecks](https://www.amazon.com/Bottlenecks-Aligning-Design-User-Psychology/dp/1484225791), that according to the survey carried out on the cooking site, [allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com.au/?rum=us), 73% of its users were on task-positive mode when they visited the site, meaning they had a goal in mind at the time of visit. Let’s assume [taste.com.au](http://taste.com.au/), the Australian version of allrecipes would have similar number of visitors in task-positive mode. That means the least both sites can consider is a design that suits the users with goals.

Let’s compare the two cooking sites, to see if and how they have adapted their design to suit.

_taste.com.au Home Page_

As a user with a goal in mind, which is finding a good recipe for a “ flourless chocolate cake”, I go to taste.com.au first. I click in the search field which is on top of the home page.

I then type my search phrase in the field. While I am typing, the autocomplete gives me a whole bunch of suggestions, from recipes to articles, collections and other popular searches which are irrelevant to my search and frustratingly distractive.

Another odd thing is that the phrase “ flourless chocolate cake” is repeated three times in the autocomplete suggestion list. It seems that for each single recipe, one line is added to the suggestion list. Confused and uncertain, I click on one of the three suggestions with the matching keywords.

Next I go to allrecipes.com. As soon as I click on the search field, the background is deemed (similar to the modal or lightbox concept). This helps me focus on my goal which is finding my recipe, without any distraction.

I then start typing, I get only two autocomplete suggestions. Nice and clean!

Pinterest has also done a good job of adapting its design to suit visitors with or without goals.

## Pinterest’s interface for a visitor with a goal:

Clicking the search field makes the background deemed so you don’t get distracted with the pretty colours of the background. The autocomplete suggestions are pretty clever too. The first few items are based on your search history and the rest are trending search keywords that match with your profile (yeah right, typical female my age only thinks about weddings!!!!). Once the the keywords become less relevant at the bottom of the list, the font colours are faded too.

## Pinterest’s interface for a visitor without a goal:

Interface for a daydreamer is also nothing but perfect. Once you show interest in a topic, your profile is shaped around that.

The similarities between the your interests and suggested pins are so much that it makes you wonder if they have a hidden microphone in your room OR maybe they have the search engines and artificial intelligence that can easily figure out that if you show interest in healthy food, you are most probably interested in yoga as well. This relevance of their content with your interest makes you wander for longer and that’s exactly what they want, isn’t it? The ads are also so relevant to your profile (native ads??) and the interface is so blended with the main content that you don’t even realise they are ads unless you click on them.

## Considerations

In summary, if you want to take your users state of mind into consideration, here are the things you should consider next time you decide to design an application :

* Ask yourself (and validate) if your users visit your app with a goal in mind or not.
* If you have users with goals, consider investing on a good search engine, declutter your design and follow a design pattern that focuses on one thing at the time, e.g, if there is a form they need to fill out, why not ask for each piece of information on a single page and move on to the next page for the next piece, similar to the Airbnb design model.
* The mobile technology could be a perfect platform for designing apps for users with goals as the size constraints lead you to a more focused design.
* If you have users with no particular goals, avoid engaging them in tasks that need too much cognitive effort. Make the visit easy and effortless for them by giving them suggestions for cruising around your app and clicking one thing after another.
* Remember, for business models that support ads, the value of keeping each user with no goals engaged for longer is more than getting new users (based on your Attentional Inventory equal to: the number of ad placements per page X the number of unique users per month X the number of visits per user X the number of clicks (ad reloads) per visit X the number of clicks (ad reloads) per visit)
* For ad supporting businesses, make sure the ads blend in with the main content and if possible relevant to the user profile
* If you have users of both types, adapt you design to suit
